        <h3><b><u>Btech project: Non-uniform deblurring of shaken images</u><b></b></h3>
        <p><i>The project aimed at deblurring images using a non conventional method with a non-uniform 
            blur kernel. The result was a better version of a deblurred image than a conventional deblurred image. 
            The tool used to implement this project was MATLAB R2010a.</i></p>

        <h3><b><u>MTech Project: Modified SLM scheme without side information for MIMO-
            OFDM systems</u></b></h3>
            <p><i>This project focuses on reducing the PAPR ( Peak to average power ratio) in MIMO-
            OFDM systems which in turn increases the system efficiency in mobile
            communication networks. Unlike in existing models, there is also an increased data
            rate since side information is not transmitted. Simulation of this project is done in
            MATLAB R2013a.</i></p>
